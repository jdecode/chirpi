### Notes about Ubuntu
1. I use Ubuntu (22.x LTS)
2. I am using Ubuntu since 2005 (back when they used to send a CD in the mail)
3. I have had "ZERO" problems while setting up Docker on my Ubuntu machine
4. If you are a developer using Windows, please stop and change your career.
   1. Unless you are using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
   2. In which case, why not just use Ubuntu directly?
5. If you are a developer using Mac, please stop and change your career.
   1. Unless you know how to solve your Docker issues
   2. I have had way too many people with Docker issues on Mac
6. Use Ubuntu, save yourself the headache
